# Where does the name come from? 

9 Line Defense comes from my personal philosophy of having a layered defense in IT. One of those layers being Knowledge. Knowledge is they key to growth and sharing this knowledge becomes important to our new people coming into IT/Cyber Security. This projects goal is share knowledge in the most efficient method possible. I find that those in the technology space are not as extroverted as those in other fields and we tend to love our guides and subreddits. I put this together to allow for a central repository of guides that can also **be taken offline**, for instance if you work in the goverment where Air Gapped Networks are common. 

# What are the 9 Lines of Defense

This is by far a personal philosophy of managing teams. No one person can be good at everything however everyone can provide something. I firmly believe that if these 9 Tenants are followed in an IT/Cyber Team than you can not go wrong. This site is embodying the 1st and 2nd of those tenants.

4. Ambition
5. Configuration Management
6. Right tools for the Job
7. Plan for the Worst
8. Lifecycle Management
9. Scoped Teams
