# Welcome to Brain Picker 

** I created a virtual one for you because I'm tired of you picking mine.**

  

## Philosophy

All to often it is difficult to learn new things. Especially in technology fields where the path to a solution or setup can often be paved with many hours of blood, sweat and typing. This website is meant to alleviate all of that by allowing you to let me do the blood, sweat and yelling on your behalf. Here you will find the curated knowledge and how-to guides that I wish that I had. I **hope** one day this will make learning a topic or setting something up easier for someone.
