# Welcome to 9 Line Defense's Knowledge Base!

## 9 Lines of Defense

This is by far a personal philosophy of managing teams of Cyber Professionals. No one person can be good at everything however everyone can provide something. Not everyone will agree with the items I have put below and most will not agree that they even embody a defensive strategy for IT. However I firmly believe that if these 9 Tenants are followed in an IT/Cyber Team than you can not go wrong. Defense must embody more than Cyber Security. During my time in the Air Force I have learned that Defense or Mission Assurance is more than AV Software and Monitoring. It is everything that touches our networks and systems. Including the systems themselves. There is no difference to an organization at the end user level between a ransomware attack that locks all of the companies data and a disaster where all the primary data sources are lost and there are no backups. To reach my end goal I have created this site, this site is embodying the 1st and 2nd of the tenants below.

1. Smart & Inquisitive Technicians
2. Thorough & Often Training
3. Competant & Truthful Vendors
4. Ambition
5. Configuration Management
6. Right tools for the Job
7. Plan for the Worst
8. Lifecycle Management
9. Scoped Teams

## Philosophy

All to often it is difficult to learn new things. Especially in technology fields where the path to a solution or setup can often be paved with many hours of blood, sweat and typing. This website is meant to alleviate all of that by allowing you to let me do the blood, sweat and yelling on your behalf. Here you will find the curated knowledge and how-to guides that I wish that I had. I **hope** one day this will make learning a topic or setting something up easier for someone.
