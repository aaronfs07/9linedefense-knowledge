## What is Unifi?

UniFi is Ubiquiti’s line of networking equipment with different models of wireless access points, routers, switches, cameras, and access control and many other products. UniFi equipment exists somewhere between enterprise and home networking appliances. It’s in the middle ground, offering more flexibility and features than most consumer-grade brands, but lacking the expense and complexity of enterprise grade equipment at a much higher price point.
