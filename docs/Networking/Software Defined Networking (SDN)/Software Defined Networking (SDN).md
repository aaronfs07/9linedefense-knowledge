# Software Defined Networking (SDN)

## Description: 
From Wikipedia:
``
Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management.
``

In other words it is a different approach to network management, instead of managing it using CLI and fledgling documentation you can now manage it using a central controller or management interface otherwise called a **Control Plane**.

## Control Plane 
The concept of the Control Plane is important to the function of SDN. Control Planes enable the programming of network behavior in a centrally controlled manner through software applications using open APIs. By opening up traditionally closed network platforms and implementing a common SDN control layer, operators can manage the entire network and its devices consistently, regardless of the complexity of the underlying network technology.
